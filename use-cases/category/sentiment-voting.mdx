## Overview

Sentiment Voting lets communities and brands tap into the real-time opinions of engaged users by leveraging attention points as voting weight.

Unlike likes or replies, attention points are earned — making every vote more credible.

## Why it matters

- Influence is earned, not farmed.
- Brands get honest market sentiment.
- Communities can vote on key decisions with skin in the game.

## Examples

- **Should a creator launch their token on Blast or Base?**
- **Should a brand drop a collab with Project A or Project B?**
- **Should we integrate feature X next?**

## How It Works

1. Creators/Brands post a poll to attention holders.
2. Users cast votes weighted by their earned attention points.
3. Results are publicly visible.

## Who can use it?

- **Creators** — to co-create with their fans.
- **Brands** — to test waters before launch.
- **DAOs** — to gather community pulse without snapshot votes.

<Tip>Sentiment Voting works best when users have skin in the game. The more they engage, the more their vote matters.</Tip>
