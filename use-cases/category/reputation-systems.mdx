## Overview

Reputation shouldn’t just be based on wallet age or token count.  
With Attenomics, it’s based on attention — who’s consistently earning it, and who’s giving it to the right causes.

It’s Proof-of-Engagement, not just Proof-of-Existence.

## Why it matters

- Track meaningful contribution and community respect.
- Signal credibility across dApps and DAOs.
- Make Sybil attacks harder by valuing real engagement.

## Examples

- **Top contributors in DAO chats? Rank them by attention earned.**
- **Onboarding roles in communities? Gate it with reputation scores.**
- **Hiring in web3? Check engagement-backed social proof.**

## How It Works

1. Attention scores accumulate over time from interactions.
2. A composite reputation score is calculated from earned and distributed attention.
3. This score can be surfaced in UIs or used in access control.

## Who can use it?

- **DAOs** — to surface trusted contributors.
- **Communities** — to auto-gate perks or status.
- **Recruiters** — to identify high-signal talent.

<Note>Reputation built on attention can't be bought — it must be earned.</Note>
