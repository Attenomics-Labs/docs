## Overview

Prediction Markets turn attention into a signal for forecasting outcomes.  
The more attention a topic or project receives, the stronger its perceived probability.

It’s like Polymarket — but powered by engagement.

## Why it matters

- Forecast outcomes using real engagement.
- Crowd predictions based on attention signals.
- Let users earn for accurate foresight.

## Examples

- **Which project will announce a token first — Zora or Paragraph?**
- **Will BTC hit $80K by June?**
- **Which L2 will win the attention war in Q3?**

## How It Works

1. Builders/brands set up markets on top of attention.
2. Users stake attention points to back an outcome.
3. Correct predictions earn attention yield or other rewards.

## Who can use it?

- **Builders** — to get early market sentiment on launches.
- **Protocols** — to run fun, gamified ecosystems.
- **Analysts** — to trade on real-time public sentiment.

<Tip>Attention-based prediction markets flip speculation into signal — because hype alone isn’t enough, sustained attention is.</Tip>
