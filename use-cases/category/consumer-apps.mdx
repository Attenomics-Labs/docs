## Overview

Build lightweight, viral apps on top of attention.  
From streak counters to anonymous message boards — let users play with engagement in new ways.

Think NGL meets Farcaster meets Time.fun — but all powered by on-chain attention data.

## Why it matters

- Keep users coming back with streak mechanics.
- Make attention feel interactive and rewarding.
- Build low-lift social experiences that plug into existing networks.

## Examples

- **Streak Trackers** — stay on top of creator-fan interaction streaks.
- **Top Fan Dashboards** — visualize who's engaging most over time.
- **Anonymous Q&A** — let users send messages and earn attention on responses.

## How It Works

1. Apps track engagement between users and creators.
2. Users earn attention points or ranks by participating.
3. Apps gamify this data into shareable social loops.

## Who can use it?

- **Creators** — to keep fans engaged outside of posting.
- **Builders** — to launch quick consumer tools and MVPs.
- **Communities** — to reward interaction, not just presence.
