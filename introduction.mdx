## Welcome to Attenomics

**Attenomics** is a verifiable attention engine that transforms social media engagement into measurable, on-chain value.

We believe that **attention is the new currency**, and **engagement is the transaction** that powers it.

> In the Attention Economy, your likes, reposts, and shares aren’t just noise — they’re value-generating actions.

---

### What this means:

- **Attention** is scarce — like money, it flows where it's earned.
- **Engagement** is proof-of-work — it represents action taken.
- By putting both on-chain, we create a transparent and fair system where users, creators, and brands all benefit.
