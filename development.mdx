---

We’re building the **Attention Layer** — a permissionless infrastructure where anyone can build, remix, or compose new use cases on top of attention data.

Right now, Attenomics is in early access. But soon, the infrastructure will be fully open to developers.

---

## What You’ll Be Able to Build

- **Custom Attention Campaigns**  
  Spin up your own campaigns and route rewards based on attention earned.

- **Loyalty and Referral Apps**  
  Use attention as a reward unit across existing communities.

- **Prediction Markets & Fan Indexes**  
  Create attention-driven outcomes like leaderboard voting, launch sentiment, and fan-powered decision making.

- **Composability Hooks**  
  Plug attention scores into other contracts, LLMs, or social graphs.

---

## What's Coming

- ✅ Open APIs to query user/creator attention  
- ✅ Smart contracts to read/write on-chain shares  
- ✅ SDKs to create, distribute, and analyze attention flows  
- ✅ Developer dashboard for testing + campaign simulation

> Think of it as a social layer that anyone can build on — with real-time signals.
