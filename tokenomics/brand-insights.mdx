## How It Works

1. Brands launch a campaign or poll.
2. Fans and creators engage.
3. Engagement is tracked and converted into attention tokens.
4. Brands view live dashboards showing token distribution, fan alignment, and sentiment trends.

## Example Use Case

Nike is deciding between sponsoring two creators.

Instead of running a traditional poll, they use Attenomics to:

- View on-chain engagement for both creators.
- Understand which communities support them.
- Launch an attention poll to let fans vote using creator tokens.
- Track sentiment and distribute campaign rewards accordingly.

## Unlock Network-Level Insights

> Brands don’t just get to know what’s happening.  
> They get to know **who made it happen** — and why.

This turns sponsorship, marketing, and product feedback into a **tokenized attention loop** that scales with community energy.

## TL;DR

> Creators and users are your new growth engine.  
> With Attenomics, you can finally measure and activate that engine.
