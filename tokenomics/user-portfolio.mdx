## What Is a User Portfolio?

Your **Attenomics Portfolio** is a real-time view of all the creator tokens you've earned by engaging with content across social media.

You’re not just a follower anymore, you’re a stakeholder in the creators you support.

## What You’ll See

Each user gets a personalized portfolio dashboard that shows:

## How It Updates

The portfolio updates daily.  
Every time you like, comment, or repost content from a registered creator, you earn a slice of their attention distribution pool.

The more you engage, the more tokens you earn and the higher you climb in fan rankings.

## Why It Matters

This isn't about passively following someone.

You're earning ownership in the communities you help grow.

You can:

- **Track your attention stake**
- **Trade your tokens**
- **Influence creator decisions**
- **Access gated perks and campaigns**

## TL;DR

> Your portfolio = your on-chain proof of support  
> Finally, engagement that counts.
