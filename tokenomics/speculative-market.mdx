## Not Just Points. These Are Assets.

Creator tokens aren’t vanity scores, they’re **on-chain assets** with growing utility.

They represent your stake in a creator’s attention. As attention increases, so can the value of the token.

## Trading Dynamics

Once launched, each creator token gets a **bonding curve** to enable price discovery. The more demand (i.e. people earning or buying), the higher the token price.

The supply is limited by attention — not inflation — which means tokens get harder to earn as creators grow.

---

## Future Plans

We're building toward:

- Cross-chain liquidity support
- Integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXes)
- Creator token indexes and baskets
- Use in staking, prediction markets, and lending

## Why This Matters

Fans are no longer just an audience.  
They are early backers.  
They hold attention, speculate on influence, and help shape creator reputation.

---

## TL;DR

> Creator tokens are the stock of the attention economy.  
> Buy early. Engage often. Grow with the creator.
