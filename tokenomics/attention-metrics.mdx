## What Counts as Attention?

Not all engagement is created equal.  
Attenomics uses a weighted model to assign real value to actions like:

- Likes  
- Comments  
- Reposts  
- Quote tweets  
- Replies  
- Platform reach and velocity

## The Formula

We use a dynamic scoring system that considers:

| Action Type      | Weight |
|------------------|--------|
| Like             | 1x     |
| Comment/Reply    | 2x     |
| Repost           | 3x     |
| Quote Tweet      | 4x     |

Each day, total attention for a creator is calculated using the weighted sum of all meaningful interactions from registered users.

## Beyond Vanity Metrics

Most social tools only care about **follower count** or **total impressions**.  
We go deeper.

## Why It Matters

Creators want to know **who actually supports them**.

Brands want to know **who actually moves attention**.

Fans want to know **how much they contribute**.

Our attention metrics power all three.

## TL;DR

> Attention isn’t just a number.  
> It’s a weighted, verifiable signal of real engagement.
