## How Fans Earn Tokens

Every time a fan interacts with a creator’s content through likes, reposts, comments, or quote tweets, they help generate attention.

That attention isn’t just tracked.  
It’s rewarded.

## Attention Mining → Token Rewards

Fans earn a share of creator tokens through **attention mining**, which is calculated daily.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Track Engagement**  
   We monitor meaningful fan activity across all linked platforms.

2. **Calculate Share**  
   Each fan’s engagement is measured as a percentage of the total attention a creator received that day.

3. **Distribute Tokens**  
   Based on the creator’s configured attention allocation, tokens are split among top contributors.

## Example Breakdown

Let’s say:

- Creator earns **1,000 tokens** for the day
- They allocate **50% (500 tokens)** for fan rewards
- A fan generated **10% of that day’s engagement**

```txt
Fan earns 10% of 500 tokens = 50 Creator Tokens

## TL;DR

> The more you engage with a creator’s content,
> the more of their token you earn — it’s that simple.
