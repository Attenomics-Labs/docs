## What are Creator Tokens?

Creator Tokens are launched by social media creators to represent the share of attention they generate across platforms.  
They act as micro-economies that convert engagement into tradable tokens.

Each creator’s token is backed by real, measurable attention verified by Attenomics.

## How Creator Tokens Work

1. **Connect Socials:** Creator links all their social accounts to Attenomics.
2. **Engagement Tracked:** We measure daily impressions, likes, reposts, and meaningful activity.
3. **Attention = Supply:** Total daily engagement determines how many tokens the creator can mint.
4. **Launch Creator Token:** Creator launches their token on Attenomics.
5. **Split Supply:** Creator defines the allocation of the token across three categories:

## Daily Minting Example

Let’s say a creator generates 300k engagement points from a 1M total.  
They earn 30% of the daily attention pool.

If the total pool is **2400 tokens**, the creator receives:

```txt
2400 * 30% = 720 Creator Tokens (minted)
```

They can then allocate the 720 tokens like:

* 50% to **Attention Supply**
* 30% to **Self Supply**
* 20% to **Free Market**
