## What Are Fan Rankings?

**Fan Rankings** show how much impact a user has had on a specific creator's content over time.

They reflect:
- How early you engaged
- How often you supported
- How valuable your engagement was

## Why It Matters

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="For Users"

    href="/docs/quickstart/for-users"
  >
    Your support is <strong>visible</strong> and <strong>provable</strong>.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="For Creators"
    icon="pen-nib"
    href="/docs/quickstart/for-creators"
  >
    You know who's <strong>really riding</strong> with you.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="For Brands"

## How It Works

1. Users engage with a creator's posts
2. Their actions are scored (likes, replies, reposts, etc.)
3. Each action contributes to their **Attention Share**
4. Rankings update over time, based on rolling engagement

> Your score is dynamic — not a one-time snapshot.

## Where It's Stored

Your rank and history are tied to your wallet, stored on-chain, and visible via the creator's dashboard.

No need to re-register, no central platform deciding your worth.

## TL;DR

> Your support now mean something — and your rank proves it.
