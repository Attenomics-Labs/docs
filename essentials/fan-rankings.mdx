## What Are Fan Rankings?

**Fan Rankings** show how much impact a user has had on a specific creatorâ€™s content over time.

They reflect:
- How early you engaged
- How often you supported
- How valuable your engagement was

## How It Works

1. Users engage with a creatorâ€™s posts
2. Their actions are scored (likes, replies, reposts, etc.)
3. Each action contributes to their **Attention Share**
4. Rankings update over time, based on rolling engagement

> Your score is dynamic â€” not a one-time snapshot.
