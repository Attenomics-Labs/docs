In Web2, platforms mine your attention.  
In Web3, **you mine your own.**

---

## What is Attention Mining?

**Attention Mining** is how users and creators generate verifiable, on-chain value by posting and engaging with social content.

Instead of platforms capturing all the value, Attenomics tracks engagement across social media and converts it into **Attention Points** — measurable, transparent, and rewardable.

---

## Who Mines What?

- **Creators** mine attention by posting valuable content.
- **Users** mine attention by engaging with that content (likes, replies, reposts, quotes).

Both parties contribute to virality — so both are rewarded.

---

## What Counts as Attention?

We track:
- Likes, replies, retweets, quotes
- Relevance to current trends
- Originality and influence of the post
- Quality of engaged users (bots don’t count)

> The higher the impact, the more attention is mined.

---

## How is Attention Verified?

We use:
- A custom scoring model powered by a verifiable LLM (via **ORA RMS API**)
- Social signals fetched in real-time
- On-chain storage via ERC standards (e.g. ERC-721 with metadata)

Every score is fraud-proof and publicly auditable.

## Why This Matters

- No more fake influence — it’s all on-chain.
- Everyone earns based on real value, not just follower count.
- Attention becomes programmable — powering campaigns, rankings, and rewards.

---

## TL;DR

> Attention Mining turns your posts and engagement into on-chain value.  
> And now, you can finally own what you help create.
