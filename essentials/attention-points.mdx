**Attention Points** are the currency of the Attenomics ecosystem.  
They measure, track, and reward engagement on-chain.

## What Are Attention Points?

Attention Points represent the value generated through verifiable social engagement.

Theyâ€™re issued to creators and users based on how much attention their content generates or amplifies.

## How Are They Calculated?

We use:
- Social engagement metrics from X (likes, replies, reposts, etc.)
- A verifiable AI scoring model (via ORA RMS API)
- Trend alignment, originality, and content influence

The final score is posted on-chain â€” publicly visible, verifiable, and immutable.

---

## Where Are They Stored?

Each creator has an **on-chain identity** (NFT).  
Their latest Attention Score is stored as metadata on that NFT.  
This makes every point:
- Portable  
- Auditable  
- Tradable in the future

---

## Why Do They Matter?

- **For Users**: They prove how much influence you helped generate.  
- **For Creators**: They reflect real engagement, not just vanity metrics.  
- **For Brands**: They offer transparent insights into whoâ€™s driving real attention.

## Use Cases

- Fan rankings and supporter leaderboards
- Attention Campaign rewards
- Brand token gating and polls
- Attention as a reputation layer across apps

---

## TL;DR

> Attention Points are the on-chain proof that you showed up, engaged, and made something go viral.
