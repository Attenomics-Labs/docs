title: 'Creator Rewards'
description: 'How creators distribute attention to their supporters'
---

Most creators have followers.  
But real community? That’s built when attention flows both ways.

---

## What Are Creator Rewards?

When a creator earns Attention Points, they can choose to **distribute a portion** of it to their community — specifically, the users who engaged with their content.

This turns passive fans into **active supporters**.

---

## How It Works

- Each creator starts with **100% of their mined attention**
- They decide what % to **keep** and what % to **share**
- The shared portion is split among users based on engagement impact

> Example: A creator shares 30% of their points. Users who engaged meaningfully get a proportional share.
