# For Brands

Welcome to Attenomics! As a brand, you can launch attention campaigns and access real-time social insights to grow your presence in the attention economy.

## Premium Features

### AI-Powered Social Intelligence Agent
- **Smart Content Analysis**
  - Track user sentiment and engagement patterns

### App-Specific Use Cases

#### 1. Attention Campaigns
- Launch targeted attention campaigns
- Set custom reward structures
- Track campaign performance in real-time
- Measure attention share distribution

#### 2. Sentiment Check
Token holders don't always reflect your actual user base. For example, AAVE token holders aren't necessarily AAVE users, and many users who use and admire AAVE's work aren't token holders.

With Sentiment Check, brands can:
- Ask questions with a small reward pot
- Get weighted votes based on users' attention reputation
- Understand market sentiment beyond token ownership
- Make data-driven decisions based on community feedback
