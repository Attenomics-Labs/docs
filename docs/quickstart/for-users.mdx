# How?

When you [engage](#earn-attention-points) with a creator's content on X (reply, quote tweet, retweet, or mention), you receive a unique share of their attention value. Think of it like owning a piece of their influence. The more you support a creator, the higher your ranking becomes in their community, and the more unique attention shares you receive.

These attention shares are:
- **Unique**: Your personal stake in a creator's success
- **Tradable**: Buy and sell on decentralized exchanges
- **Monetizable**: Convert your influence into real value

For example, if you're a top supporter of a creator, you might own 5% of their total attention shares. As their influence grows, so does the value of your shares.
